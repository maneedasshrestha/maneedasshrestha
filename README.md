👋 Hey, I’m **Manee**

I write code.  
Sometimes it works.  
Sometimes it teaches me humility.

Computer Engineering student who starts projects thinking *“this’ll be quick”*  
…and ends up learning 3 new concepts, breaking 2 unrelated things, and questioning life choices.

I build things. I ship things.  
And occasionally stare at the screen, hoping the bug fixes itself.

### What I do (unprofessionally well)
- Fix one bug → unlock three new ones  
- Turn small ideas into over-engineered side projects  
- Learn just enough to be dangerous (to my own codebase)

I like making things that feel **cool**, **useful**, or at the very least **not boring**.

Currently messing around with tech, ideas, and whatever grabbed my attention this week.
